          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            I am currently working at <a href="http://www.legacy.com">Legacy.com</a>
            as a front end engineer specailizing in React and Node.
            I the Web Development Immersive program at General Assembly in Los Angeles in July of 2015.
            I also hold a BA in Philosophy from UC Santa Cruz and a paralegal certificate from the UC Berkeley Extension.
          </p>
          <p>
            Previously I worked as a paralegal for almost 10 years focused mostly on IP litigation.
            During my time as a paralegal I began using the command line as a way to automate some of my day-to-day tasks.
            The more I learned about coding generally, the more I enjoyed it.
            In March 2014, after a particularly brutal trial experience,
            I decided to move to Santa Barbara and start pursuing web development full time.

          <p>
            A guest blog post for MonkeyLearn about HashRobot, an app I built while at General Assembly.
            HashRobot is a social media assistant built with MonkeyLearn that helps Twitter users pick the right hashtags for their tweets.
            With HashRobot it’s easy to identify the most popular hashtags within a certain topic.
            Twitter users can add these hashtags to their tweets to have an edge in getting more views and increase visibility.

          <h4>The Law Office of Daniel M. Shafer<br>
            <small><a href="http://www.danshaferlaw.com">www.danshaferlaw.com</a></small></h4>
          <p>
            The client had already purchased a domain name but had not yet built a site or a hosting provider.  He requested a clean, modern looking site.  He provided me with a business card and asked me to match the font style and color.  After a few round of reviews we had the site up and running within 2 weeks.  I also created email addresses using the @danshaferlaw.com URL and walked the client through setting up his email on Outlook as well as his iPhone.  This site was built with Bootstrap and as a result looks great on any device whether it be a large desktop, an iPad, or a smart phone.
          </p>
          <h4>Law Offices of Bernadette Connolly<br>
            <small><a href="http://www.immigrationattorney-bwc.com">www.immigrationattorney-bwc.com</a></small></h4>
          <p>
            The client already had a website that they had built in-house.  They didn't have the internal resources to devote to having another site built, but they wanted something professional looking.  I managed the transfer from their previous hosting company, and got them up and running with a professional looking site.  Because they specialize in immigration law, I also set them up with a <a href="http://www.immigrationattorney-bwc.com/html/espanol/index_espanol.html">spanish mirror site</a>.  This site is optimized for mobile devices and works great on desktops and smartphones alike.
